Batch processing is realized by concatenating all graphs into a large graph of disconnected components (and all node feature tensors into a large tensor).

    The class requires problem-specific `edge_feat_func` function, which receives dict of edge attributes and returns Tensor of edge features and LongTensor of inverse indices if edge compaction was performed (less unique edge features than edges so some may be reused).
